00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.000
I made this in p5js 

2
00:00:03.251 --> 00:00:05.000
I made this with p5 dot js 

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.500
I made this with p5js 

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.250
P5js is a javascript library 

5
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.000
for making web-based 

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.500
interactive experiences 

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.250
and having fun with code. 

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.000
With p5js you can quickly create 

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.250
animations, games, 

10
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.250
data visualizations,

11
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.000
generative art, and more.


12
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.000
P5js is an amazing program 


13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.500
to get you started on

14
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.500
any animation or 

15
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.750
cool javascript project

16
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.750
that you are trying to do.

17
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.500
Programming with p5 is 

18
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.750
just like using javascript, 

19
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.750
but with built in tools 

20
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.000
for coding cool stuff.

21
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.250
It’s designed to be easy 

22
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.750
for beginners, 

23
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.000
but robust enough for 

24
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
experienced developers, designers,

25
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
dreamers, and inventors. 

26
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.000
And since browsers speak in javascript, 

27
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.750
you can share your 

28
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.000
work with others online. 

29
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It’s mobile friendly too.

30
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.500
Your imagination is the limit!

31
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.000
With just a few lines of code 

32
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
you can make shapes,

33
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
like this circle, on your screen.

34
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Without p5, writing this out 

35
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.750
would take a lot more code. 

36 
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.000 
It can multiply from there 

37
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.500
Bring them to life with movement 

38
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.250
or make them interactive. 

39
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
Try moving your mouse accross the screen.

40
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.250
P5js helps you to get your 

41
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.250
ideas on screen quickly. 

42
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.250
And since you can see the 

43
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.270
results of your code 

44
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.250
it’s a great for learning 

45 
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.750
programming concepts.

46
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.750
Its the best!

47
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.750
You can do anything you can think of.

48
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.500
P5js gets also used by 

49 
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.250
graphic designers who are not used to code.

50 
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.250
P5js gets me excited.

51
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.000
*children's laughter*

52
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.250
P5js is free and easy to set up. 

53
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.500
You can either code right in your browser 

54
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.100
using the p5 web editor, 

55
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.500
or download the javascript libraries 

56
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.500
to your computer.

57
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.250
No special software required. 

58
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.500
There are lots of great tutorials 

59
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.000
to help get you started. 

60
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.070
But if you get stuck, don’t worry, 

61
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.500
you can always ask for help 

62
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.750
in our community forums 

63
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
P5 is open-source. 

64
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.500
