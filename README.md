# Hello P5.js Webpage


## Overview
The goal of this project was to modernize the hello.p5js.org website though development of a new trailer featuring diverse members of the Processing community.

## Project Description
hello.p5js.org is likely to be many users’ first introduction to p5.js (and possibly Processing as well). As these individuals may be brand new to coding, it is important that this webpage be inviting, interesting and informative. 

## Shout Outs
I would like to thank my mentor Evelyn Masso, and Lauren McCarthy for their support and feedback. I would also like to acknowledge the awesome community members who contributed survey responses, videos and code:

## Tasks Completed
* Met with Lauren McCarthy and mentor to determine requirements for the new hello.p5.js website
* Created a new code-base for the project using modern web tools (eg: Node, Browserify, Plyr)
* Enabled multilingual captioning on video player using WebVTT files
* Wrote code to toggle between languages using non-HTML video controls
* Developed a survey to gather feedback from the community regarding what they use p5js for, and what they like about it
* Promoted survey on Github, Processing Forum, and Twitter
* Analyzed results, identified key features, and incorporated feedback into a video script 
* Drew video storyboards for feedback from mentor and Lauren
* Designed UX wireframes to illustrate how  p5.js sketches would be overlayed on video content, how captions would appear, and how users would control the video
* Recorded draft video as proof of concept for the final project
* Recruited volunteers for the video through a second online survey
* Corresponded with community leaders to ensure diverse representation in the video
* Promoted second survey on Github, Processing Forum, and Twitter
* Coordinated video making tasks with members of the community
* Coded and modified p5.js sketches to be overlaid on the video content
* Secured Spanish and French translation for video content
* Consulted media professionals to ensure high quality look and feel
* Procured background music samples from several musicians and gathered feedback from mentor 
* Edited video clips together using Adobe Premier, Audition, and After Effects


## Contribution & Next Steps
I created a video and draft website to launch the new and improved hello.p5js.org. Before going live, I will coordinate with Processing to ensure the site's content meets the Processing foundations’ standards. I will also make sure it loads properly across devices.

## To Install & Set Up Repository

* First, ensure that node.js & npm are both installed. If not, choose your OS and installation method from [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and follow the instructions.

```sh
git clone XXX.XX
cd hello-p5
npm install
```

npm run watch will start a new server, open up a browser and watch for any SCSS or JS changes in the `src` directory , as well as any changes to the video fonts and captions in the `src` directory; once it compiles those changes, the browser will automatically inject the changed file(s)! 

This project's Build Process is based of the NPM Build Boilerplate:
